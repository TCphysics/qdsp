# QDSP

QDSP, short for "Quick, Dynamic Scatter Plot" (or alternatively, "Quick and Dirty Scatter Plot") is a lightweight C library for creating dynamic, real-time scatter plots. It was originally created to render phase plots for particle-in-cell plasma simulations.

QDSP is still in early development, and should not be considered stable under any circumstances. The API could change without warning (at least until version 1.0.0 is released).
