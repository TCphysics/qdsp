# QDSP

## About

QDSP, short for "Quick Dynamic Scatter Plot" (or alternatively, "Quick and Dirty
Scatter Plot") is a lightweight C library for creating dynamic, real-time
scatter plots. It was originally created to render phase plots for
particle-in-cell plasma simulations.

QDSP uses semantic versioning, so any changes made after 1.0.0 will be
backwards-compatible (until I realize that I've made an unforgivable design
decision and end up releasing 2.0.0).

## Installation

So far, QDSP is only ported to Linux. There's a good chance that it will work on
Mac, but I haven't tested it. At some point in the future, I'll redo the build
system in CMake and make sure it runs on everything.

QDSP requires the following dependencies, which should be available in most
package repositories:

* [GLFW 3](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest)
* [SOIL](http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html)
* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)

In addition, [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) is required to generate easily
readable documentation.

To install, just run:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig

After building, this will install the shared library to `/usr/local/lib`, the
header to `/usr/local/include`, and resources to `/usr/local/share/qdsp`. You
may need to add `/usr/local/lib` to your system's ldconfig path.

## Usage

Just put `#include <qdsp.h>` in your code and link with -lqdsp.

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated by `cd`ing into the `docs` directory and running
`doxygen`.

Look at the file `src/example.c` for a basic example of a phase plot with QDSP
(run `make example` if you want to try it out). It uses QDSP to render the phase
plot of a 1D PIC simulation.

## License

QDSP is licensed under the LGPL. This means you can use it for pretty much
anything, but a modified version of the library itself can only be distributed
under a compatible license. For more information, see the `LICENSE` file.
